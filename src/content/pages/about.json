  "history": [
    "Jerome Bible Baptist Church was established as an independent Baptist congregation on August 30, 1946, with 88 charter members. N.S. Anderson served as the first pastor, and the church officially adopted its name \"Bible Baptist Church\" on September 8, 1946.",
    "Our congregation initially met in the Civic Club rooms within the local library building for approximately eighteen months. In July 1947, construction began on a Quonset metal building located on Second Avenue East, and we held our first service there on December 14, 1947.",
    "As membership grew to 175, we expanded our facilities with additions including a furnace room, restrooms, baptistery, ten classrooms, nursery, and pastor's office. In 1967, Brother Everett Winfrey initiated our \"KART radio ministry.\" We continued to grow, purchasing adjacent property in 1970 and completing basement construction in 1971 and 1972.",
    "In 1978, we acquired the Grange Hall for youth programs. A significant milestone came in 1981 with the completion of our 450-seat auditorium, followed by a joyful mortgage-burning ceremony in 1984 that drew 316 people in celebration.",
    "Today, Jerome Bible Baptist Church continues to serve our community with the same dedication to biblical truth and authentic faith that our founders established nearly 80 years ago. We remain committed to preaching God's Word and serving as everyday people devoted to an amazing God."
